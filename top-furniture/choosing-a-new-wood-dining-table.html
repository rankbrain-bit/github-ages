	<h1>Choosing a New Wood Dining Table</h1>
	<p>When the time comes to choose a new dining table, your options can seem endless. The trend in modern homes is for wooden dining tables, as these tend to be long lasting and are relatively easy to care for. They also look great in most homes, and come in a range of styles and finishes to suit the interior decor.</p>
	<p>For many families, the dining table is more than just a piece of furniture. It is a place where meals are shared and friends are entertained, and so a new table needs to fit the bill in terms of your lifestyle. It can be tempting to rush into buying a new table, but a little planning and research can help you choose a table you can enjoy for years.</p>
	<h2>Tables for large families</h2>
	<p>If you have a large family, or occasionally cater for large groups at home then <a href="https://www.topfurniture.co.uk/oak-dining-furniture/table-styles/extending-dining-tables.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>extending oak dining tables</strong></em></span></a> are the ideal option, especially if you want to save space. Extending tables give you the flexibility to have a larger or smaller tabletop space depending on your needs at each meal.</p>
	<p>If you have the space, it is always better to get a slightly larger table than you think you might need. For example, if you are a family of four then choose a 6 seater table if you have the room for it. This makes it easier to serve meals and gives space for platters on special occasions. A larger table can also make a useful workspace for the kids to do their homework.</p>
	<h2>Compact dining tables</h2>
	<p>For really small spaces, dining tables which can be fit into a corner are useful, so choose a two seater square table to maximise on space. Breakfast bars are a good choice for homes that don&rsquo;t have space for a dedicated dining room, and are convenient for small families and families with older children on different work or study schedules.</p>
	<p>Stools and stacking chairs work well in small homes, whereas heavier chairs such as <a href="https://www.topfurniture.co.uk/oak-dining-furniture/oak-dining-chairs.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>oak dining chairs</strong></em></span></a> can also be great especially if they can be neatly tucked away beneath the table. For small spaces where there isn&rsquo;t a frequent need for a dining table, tables which can be folded away are perfect for occasional use. These are a stylish option for apartments and other more compact spaces and are very simple to use. Many have metal legs which fold into place and lock, and can be quickly unlocked and folded away again.</p>

	<h2>Choosing a dining table shape and size</h2>
	<p>The right dining table for your living room depends on the size and shape of the room. As a general rule, choose round or square tables for square rooms, and choose rectangular or oval tables for rectangular rooms. By keeping to this rule you can ensure your dining table is a good fit for your space.</p>
	<p>In order for diners and guests to feel they have enough space, you will want to make sure there is at least 2 to 3 foot of room between someone when seated and the nearest wall. This should give them plenty of space to move around the table and find their seat without bumping into anyone else.</p>
	<h2>Caring for wooden dining tables</h2>
	<p>Large <a href="https://www.topfurniture.co.uk/oak-dining-furniture/oak-table-chair-sets.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>oak dining tables</strong></em></span></a> and tables made from other hardwoods can be exceptionally heavy, so choose their positioning carefully and try not to move them around by dragging them. Dragging heavy wooden furniture can cause weak points in the joints and eventually cause the table to break. Solid wood tables do have some simple care considerations, but they are well worth taking the time to address as doing so will increase the lifespan of your table.</p>
	<p>Most tables will leave the manufacturer with a good, long lasting surface treatment already applied. Oil is a popular finish for solid woods as it penetrates deep into the wood grain, and protects it without affecting the look of the wood too much. Pale oils can be used to preserve the natural tone of the wood, while darker and tinted oils have a stronger transformative effect.</p>
	<p>If you buy a pre-treated table then you are unlikely to need to treat it again for some time. In fact, oiled and waxed woods only need treating when they begin to show the early signs of drying out.</p>
