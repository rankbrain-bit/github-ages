	<h1>A Guide to Wedding Planning</h1>
	<p>Weddings are a special kind of event that many of us hold dear. Religious or not, marriage is a well loved and much respected tradition that celebrates love between people. It also has a legal bearing, and couples should always understand these when they tie the knot. Getting married therefore is something that is taken very seriously by couples, and for many, getting the wedding day celebrations just right is deeply important.</p>
	<p>Despite some cultural and legal differences, weddings tend to include a ceremony followed by a celebration. There is a trend towards expensive weddings, and the average amount of money put down by couples grows every year. It is not uncommon to see weddings costing anywhere up to &pound;50,000 or more, though most fall around the &pound;15,000 mark.</p>
	<p>With such a lot of financial investment being out into weddings, couples feel a lot of pressure to get everything right. Those with the budget to do so may prefer to hire a wedding planner to curate their day, but it is much more common to see couples take on the planning for themselves.</p>
	<p>Everything from <a href="https://www.venuehub.hk/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>venue hire</strong></em></span></a> to catering, entertainment and ceremony choice must be accounted for, and with so much to plan it can be easy to overlook certain things. This guide will help you to stay on track by covering the basics.</p>
	<h2>Choose a venue that you love</h2>
	<p>The right venue can make or break your wedding celebrations, and is often one of the most difficult and expensive aspects of the day. Look for a venue that speaks to you when you visit. Not literally of course, but the right venue will feel like a place you want to spend time in and suits the overall theme and look you want to create for your wedding. From rustic barns to sleek, modern hotels, there are a huge number of venues to choose from and all will have their own unique atmosphere.</p>
	<p>The best place to shop around for venues is online. Search for venues in the area you want to get married in and create a shortlist of venues you would like to visit in person with your partner. You should give yourself as much time as possible when looking for a venue, as the best ones often get booked up well in advance. Some couples have been known to wait two or more years for their perfect <a href="https://www.venuehub.hk/venues/type/wedding-venues-in-hong-kong"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>wedding venue hire</strong></em></span></a> to become available for their preferred date.</p>

	</p>
	<h2>Set a budget</h2>
	<p>Your budget will remain integral to your wedding day plans, so keep a close eye on expenditures. Make a note of all the fees and deposits paid, and don&rsquo;t forget to factor in for the total balances in your overall budget. This way you can avoid any unexpected overspending which is easy to do when you are caught up in planning so many different elements for your wedding.</p>
	<p>The budget is often a point of contention between couples when planning a wedding. Avoid any potential conflict by having open, honest discussions about your budget to make sure you are both on the same page and are keeping things realistic. You should always allow for some wiggle room within your budget, as unexpected costs do often creep up and will need accounting for.</p>
	<h2>Decide on a guest list</h2>
	<p>Guest lists can be a difficult one for some couples, especially if they have very different ideas on what the perfect wedding day looks like in terms of size. If one of you wants a small, intimate wedding and the other wants to invite a large number of guests, you will need to work together to find a compromise. Your <a href="https://www.venuehub.hk/venue-types/party-room"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>party room hire</strong></em></span></a> must be big enough to accommodate your party size whether that is large or small.</p>
	<p>A good way to compromise on guest numbers is to have a smaller ceremony with your nearest and dearest in attendance, and then have a larger reception party with your extended circle of family and friends.</p>
	<p>Some very small venues can only accommodate a limited number of guests, so if this is the case for your wedding, you may need to make some difficult decisions on whether to make your guest list smaller or use an alternative venue.</p>
